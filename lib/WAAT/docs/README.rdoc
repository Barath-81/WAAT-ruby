== What is Web Analytics

Web Analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of internet data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage. Web Analytics is not just a tool for measuring website traffic, but can also be used as a tool for business research and market research.
Web Analytics applications can also help companies measure the results of traditional print advertising campaigns. It helps one to estimate how the traffic to the web site changed after the launch of a new advertising campaign.

Web Analytics provides data on the number of visitors, page views, etc. to gauge the traffic popularity trends which helps doing the market research.
Official definition of Web Analytics from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics)
